    <h1>Albums of 2008</h1>

    <div class="album-entry">
	  <div class="album-number">10</div>
      <div class="album-name">
        <div class="artist">Cut Copy</div>
        <div class="title">In Ghost Colours</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">Melbourne electronic act Cut Copy fuse extremely catchy lyrical riffs with uplifting electronic synthpop.  A great summer album with plenty of anthems which work both in the club and outside of it.  Even my girlfriend approved of this one.</div>

      <div class="album-name">
        <div class="artist">M83</div>
        <div class="title">Saturdays = Youth</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">I first got into M83 with the album "Before The Dawn Heals Us", which contains some incredibly atmospheric pieces of music, notably "Teen Angst" and the 10 minute cinematic epic "Lower Your Eyelids To Die With The Sun". "Saturdays = Youth" is a much more accessible record, pulling back on the epics (though there is still some of that in here) and pushing for a more 80's synth rock style record, and it still works.</div>

        <div class="artist">Death Cab For Cutie</div>
        <div class="title">Narrow Stairs</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">Death Cab for me are just one of those bands that you know every album they release is going to be one to enjoy.  I first fell in love to them thanks to the stellar "Transatlanticism" (if you haven't heard this, I heartily recommend you seek it out), but follow up "Plans" was somewhat of a let down, even though it was still a great album.  Their latest effort "Narrow Stairs" is somewhere between "Plans" and "Transatlanticism".  It has some fantastic moments (intro "Bixby Canyon Bridge", "Grapevine Fires", "Long Division") but also some skippable filler tracks ("Talking Bird" and "You Can Do Better Than Me").  Despite the low moments, its still a cracking album, and having had the privilege of seeing these guys live this year, I can safely say Death Cab firmly remain as one of my favourite bands.</div>      <div class="album-cover"><img src="images/8.jpg" /></div>

      <div class="album-name">
        <div class="artist">Kyte</div>
        <div class="title">Kyte</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">Not so sure if this qualifies as a full length album since its sold as an EP, but with 7 tracks and totalling in around 40 minutes, it certainly qualifies an album, and an absolute beaut of one at that.  Mellow ambient with electronic elements and soothing vocals.  Kyte also released a second EP this year entitled "Two Sparks, Two Stars" also well worth checking out.</div>      <div class="album-cover"><img src="images/7.jpg" /></div>

        <div class="artist">Balmorhea</div>
        <div class="title">River Arms</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">Guitars, pianos, banjos and voices: "River Arms" seems like Balmorhea's first full effort of going into a studio and recording a full quality record, including re-recordings of tracks from the raw predecessor self-titled album. An excellent album to unwind to, although theres still something I prefer about the self-titled album.  Either way, both are fantastic - can't wait to hear more from these guys.</div>

      <div class="album-name">
        <div class="artist">Bon Iver</div>
        <div class="title">For Emma, Forever Ago</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">So the story goes... singer-songwriter Justin Vernon retreated to a remote cabin in Wisconsin after a traumatic breakup.  There he recorded the majority of this album, a powerful compilation of folk songs visiting love, loss and loneliness.  Regardless of the hype the story created with this album, the album stands up to the hype, despite some occasional seemingly nonsensical lyrics.  One of my regrets of this year was not being able to see these guys when they visited Ireland.  For Shame (Forever ago)...</div>

        <div class="artist">Sigur R&oacute;s</div>
        <div class="title">Me&eth; su&eth; &iacute; eyrum vi&eth; spilum endalaust</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">For those of you not fluent in Icelandic, the album title translates to "with a buzz in our ears we play endlessly".  These guys playing endlessly certainly sounds like a fine plan to me!  I've seen these guys twice now (2005 in Dublin and this year at Pukkelpop) and both gigs were a completely inspirational experience. "Me&eth; su&eth; &iacute; eyrum vi&eth; spilum endalaust", when compared with previous albums, seems like the band taking a perscription of happy pills, throwing one heck of a party, and then coming down towards the end.  Its a party I'd be a happy to a part of.</div>

        <div class="artist">Maybeshewill</div>
        <div class="title">Not For Want of Trying</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">It's no secret that I'm a huge fan of post-rock.  Most post-rock that I listen to consists of atmosphere, melody and emotion.  Very little of the post-rock I listen to, unforunately, couples all these things with aggression and full-on energy (the other notable exception to this is my favourite local band, And So I Watch You From Afar).  This is where UK band Maybeshewill come in, with their fantastic debut full-length album.  Highlights include "Seraphim & Cherubim", "He Films The Clouds, Part 2? and title track "Not For Want of Trying", which samples 70's film "Network" in a rant about the breakdown of society and the economy, even more poignant now with the current economic crisis happening around the world.  Its also very much worth checking out the band's latest EP, a split with Her Name is Calla, which includes two cracking tracks from Maybeshewill.</div>

      <div class="album-name">
        <div class="artist">Glasvegas</div>
        <div class="title">Glasvegas</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">I have to admit it took me quite a while to warm to this band.  My first time even hearing of the band was frontman James Allan's terrible appearance on TV show "Never Mind the Buzzcocks", where he appeared to have been in desperate need of some funny pills, as well as looking somewhat ridiculous sporting a pair of sunglasses in a tv studio.  Add on top of that the fact that word had been getting around that (wrongly) these guys were tipped to be the next Oasis.  This didn't exactly encourage me to listen to the band, but thanks to a persistant friend and seeing several recommendations for the album online, I decided to give it a go.  At first I struggled to get used to Allan's strong Glaswegian accent which is prominent throughout the entirity of the album.  Hearing loutish chants of "Here we, here we, here we fucking go" during songs also threatened to curb any chance I had of liking this band.  Eventually repeated listens prevailed, I got over the Glasgow accent and fell in love with the lushious soundscapes, the heartfelt stories within the songs and hell, even the accent.  Opening track "Flowers & Football Tops" conveys the emotions of how it feels to lose a son, with the touching finish of "You are my sunshine, my only sunshine... how could they take my sunshine away", while "Daddy's Gone" displays a son's anger and hate towards his dad for walking out on his family.  The genuine songs, unashamed to reference the hardships of growing up in a tough area with a broken family, coupled with the wall of sound (reminiscent of My Bloody Valentine) makes this album an absolute essential.</div>

        <div class="title">The Midnight Organ Fight</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">
	    Two Scottish bands with strong Scottish accents in their music topping my list - who'da thunk it?  I discovered these guys thanks to seeing their name listed as the support band for Death Cab For Cutie prior to their Dublin gig.  I always like to check out bands before gigs because if they're my kind of thing, I want to know the songs when I see them.  These guys really took me by surprise: a breakup album whose lyrics ranges from hilarious ("I'm armed with the past, and the will, and a brick") to crushing ("Why won't our love keel over as it chokes on a bone? We can mourn its passing and then bury it in snow. Or should we kick its cunt in and watch as it dies from bleeding? If you don't want to be with me just say and I will go") to strong ("You can mark my words: I'll make changes to earth").  Melodic, meaningful, fun, tragic, inspirational, this album really does its best to cover all the ranges of emotion that one goes through after a fucked up relationship.  Like frontman Scott Hutchison says, "there's nothing worse than a song without meaning" - and there's certainly none of those in here.  Scott has definitely succeeded in making a small change to Earth.
