	  <div class="album-blurb">
	    Texan four-piece instrumental post-rockers This Will Destroy You's latest album is a blend of all those which came before it.
	    Much of the drone of the previous record Tunnel Blanket is still present, lurking and swirling throughout the record, but there's
	    a much greater presence of melody this time, harking back to the sound of their excellent eponymous LP. There are plenty of dynamic shifts too,
	    with many of the tracks combining subtle, creeping beginnings with fierce and intense crescendos. At times it can drag a little, but it all comes
	    together with the beautiful finale track God’s Teeth – a sombre and moving, almost Sigur Rós-esque piece with guitars softly wailing like sirens in the background
	    – a track which wouldn't feel out of place as an epilogue for the apocalypse.

		<div class="title">St. Vincent</div>
	  </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">
	      Annie Clark’s fourth album oozes with confidence and truly feels like the work of an artist who has finally found their identity –
	      an idea that’s even suggested by the cover art and the eponymous title. The songs on the album are bold,
	      funky and fun, often experimental, yet never self-indulgent or inaccessible. This could easily be the definitive album from St. Vincent,
	      and one that any artist would be proud of having as just that, but there’s likely plenty more greatness ahead.

		<div class="artist">A Winged Victory for the Sullen</div>
		<div class="title">Atomos</div>
	  </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">
	    Atomos is the second album from the collaboration project of Dustin O’Halloran and Stars of the Lid member Adam Wiltzie. It
	    was composed as a score to a contemporary dance art piece of the same name. The album is a collection of modern
	    classical instrumental pieces – one may label it ‘ambient’, but quite often the songs on Atomos command a lot more
	    attention than what would be typical of the ambient genre label. Chaos and discord often feel like a theme on this
	    album, with the music often feeling unsettling, almost desolate; yet, there are plenty of soaring crescendos
	    and grandiose moments of majesty throughout the record. As a whole, Atomos is a beautiful piece of art that flows together
	    flawlessly, and one that deserves full attention to unravel and appreciate.

      <div class="album-name">
		<div class="artist">Kiasmos</div>
		<div class="title">Kiasmos</div>
	  </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">
          Kiasmos is a collaboration between Icelandic neoclassical composer Ólafur Arnalds and electronic producer Janus Rasmussen. Their self-titled debut album
          is a beautiful collision of classical melody and minimal techno. Opening tracks “Lit” and “Held” welcome the listener warmly with delicate
          strings and piano riffs placed against a backdrop of gently throbbing drum loops and basslines. There’s no sense of urgency from the offset;
          but although the tempo remains pretty consistent throughout, the intensity slowly builds as the record progresses to closing tracks “Bent” and
          “Burnt”, where distorted synthesizers riffs combine with menacing strings to result in an aggressive, chaotic climax to the record. This
          isn’t a record of single bangers that you’re likely to hear at the next big EDM party; this is a record that rewards patient listeners with
          a progressive journey through intelligent, evocative soundscapes, with a fair share of head bopping along the way.

      <div class="album-name">
		<div class="artist">The Antlers</div>
		<div class="title">Familiars</div>
	  </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">
	    The Antlers have previously topped my albums of the year chart, not once, but twice – first in 2009 with what is probably my favourite album of all-time,
	    the heart wrenching “Hospice”, and again in 2011 with the excellent follow-up, “Burst Apart”. Familiars falls a little short of the greatness of these albums,
	    but nonetheless has some fantastically beautiful moments, predominately in the second half of the record. Tracks like “Refuge”, “Parade” and “Director” are amongst
	    some of the best tracks the band have ever written. The production and instrumentation are also incredibly pretty and demand a great sound system or headphones
	    to truly appreciate the nuances and finer details hidden within. At first listen, Familiars can come off as sounding a little ‘samey’, but with repeated
	    listens rewards the listener with a shimmering beauty of a record, both in the quality of the music, the production and the lyrics.

      <div class="album-name">
		<div class="artist">Kishi Bashi</div>
		<div class="title">Lighght</div>
	  </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">
	    Lighght is the second album from Washington born violinist Kishi Bashi, who has previously played with the
	    likes of Regina Spector and Of Montreal. If ever there was an album that I could compare to a beautifully illustrated
	    pop-up fairytale story book, then this would certainly be it. The songs on Lighght are, for the most part, upbeat and
	    happy pop songs, with colourful lyrics complemented perfectly by pretty and wacky violin and guitar loops. There is plenty
	    of poetic beauty in the lyrics too: “Bittersweet Genesis for Him and Her” tells the story of a relationship through the
	    creation, life and death of a world; “Q&amp;A” is possibly the cutest love song you’ll ever hear; and “The Ballad of Mr Steak”
	    is a hilarious ode to "a tragic love affair about a dancing cut of tenderloin... Although he wants to ultimately be eaten,
	    his other joy in his short life is to dance." That may sound like quite the ridiculous premise, but to me, this is simply
	    the best quality of the album: it’s just so much fun.

        <div class="artist">Keaton Henson</div>
        <div class="title">Romantic Works</div>
      </div>
      <div class="album-blurb">
         Romantic Works was the first album I'd ever heard from Keaton Henson. Henson’s previous albums are singer-songwriter affairs, but Romantic Works takes
         a different route: a contemporary classical collection of melancholic instrumental pieces, along the lines of Ólafur Arnalds and Dustin O’Halloran.
         The songs mainly consist of piano, woodwind and cello, enlisting the talents of cellist Ren Ford. Without a single lyric, there is an abundance of
         beauty and sorrow in this record - “ambient poems for loneliness and anguish” as one comment online put it. This is a record I feel incredibly lucky to have found and
         one that I’ll be listening to for a very long time to come. (Unfortunately, I discovered it just too late to get the limited vinyl release. Damn.)

        <div class="artist">The War on Drugs</div>
        <div class="title">Lost in the Dream</div>
      </div>
      <div class="album-blurb">
        Many of the tracks on Lost in the Dream are catchy, nostalgic Americana rock, layered in synths, driving drum loops
        and shimmering guitar solos, immediate in their impact and yet far from devoid of soul, emotion and complexity. Standout
        tracks “Red Eyes”, “Burning” and “Under the Pressure” are sonically upbeat anthems, easily a suitable soundtrack for open-road
        top-down car adventures, and yet the lyrical content of Lost in the Dream is quite often anything but merry. Pain,
        anxiety and struggle are common themes throughout, yet this is far from a depressing album. The music often feels much
        more optimistic and triumphant than its lyrical counterpart and there are plenty of obvious musical comparisons to be made here,
        including Bruce Springsteen, Fleetwood Mac and Tom Petty to name but a few. Lost in the Dream is a great American rock album
        with plenty of appeal both above and below the surface that doesn’t suffer on repeated listens.

      <div class="album-name">
		<div class="artist">The Twilight Sad</div>
		<div class="title">Nobody Wants to Be Here and Nobody Wants to Leave</div>
	  </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">
	    It’s been 7 years since the debut album from The Twilight Sad, “Fourteen Autumns and Fifteen Winters”, a brilliant album that put
	    the band firmly on the map as one of the best current Scottish bands around for myself and surely many others. I have to admit that I struggled
	    with the two albums that proceeded the debut – it just felt that there was a quality that was absent when compared with the debut.
	    Thankfully, “Nobody Wants to Be Here and Nobody Wants to Leave” finds the band on possibly their best form yet. The album perfectly
	    captures the dark, raw and powerful energy that the band exudes so well in their live performances (their gig at the now defunct
	    Auntie Annie’s in Belfast was one of the most memorable gigs I’ve ever been to). Intense walls of sound coupled with James Graham’s
	    vicious and powerful vocals make the album an emotional assault, an almost exhausting listen, but one that certainly leaves a lasting
	    impression and comes together as probably the band’s best album yet.

      <div class="album-name">
		<div class="artist">Wild Beasts</div>
		<div class="title">Present Tense</div>
	  </div>
	  <div class="album-blurb">
	    I have to admit, English indie rockers Wild Beasts were only somewhat familiar to me prior to this year.
	    I’d spent a brief amount of time with their previous record Smother, but in retrospect, nowhere near enough time to appreciate it.
	    Thank God, then, that I was able to remedy this when Present Tense was released in January. Wild Beasts is home to not just one,
	    but two of the most beautiful and contrasting, yet complementary, voices: the divine falsetto of Hayden Thorpe and the gritty
	    baritone of Tom Fleming. Present Tense is intricate and elegant, a perfect balance of gorgeous vocals, intelligent lyrics
	    and shimmering, delicate synth lines. There are plenty of changes in pace throughout the album: opener “Wanderlust” kicks the album off
	    with sneering, confrontational anger; “Daughter” and “A Dog’s Life” are ominous, brooding and unsettling; “Sweet Spot” and “A Simple
	    Beautiful Truth” are gentle pop songs that almost have a Kate Bush flavour to them; and closer “Palace” is, well, just stunningly beautiful. Present Tense
	    comes together brilliantly, feels incredibly accomplished and honest, and is genuinely arresting. It’s a fantastic record, and
	    has opened my eyes to what has quickly become one of my favourite bands of recent times.
